		<English>    I am Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, the great hero of our nation. I served as a general in the carthage army and the romans called me Barq "thunderbolt" because i strike quickly and unexpected.

    I am responsible for creating the strategy which my son Hannibal implemented in the Second Punic War to bring the Roman Republic close to defeat.

    During the last years i was repeatedly severely wounded. I feel like my end is near and i have to prepare my son Hasdrubal for his upcoming responsibilities as the ruler of our great nation.</English>

		<English>    I am Sneferu. I built at least three pyramids that survive to this day and introduced major innovations in the design and construction of pyramids. I am the first king of the fourth dynasty and going to rule Egypt a minimum of 27 full years. 

     To undertake such massive building projects, i would have had to secure an extensive store of labour and materials, this is where my foreign policy played a large part. My conquests into Libya and Nubia served two purposes: Establish an extensive labour force, and gain access to the raw materials in these countries.

    I was able to capture large numbers of people from other nations, make them my prisoners and then add them into my labour force. My military efforts in Libya led to the capture of 11,000 prisoners and 13,100 head of cattle.
    My Son, Cheops, will follow in his fathersâ€™s footsteps once he has learned enough.</English>
