		<English>    I am Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, the great hero of our nation. I served as a general in the carthage army and the romans called me Barq "thunderbolt" because i strike quickly and unexpected.

    I am responsible for creating the strategy which my son Hannibal implemented in the Second Punic War to bring the Roman Republic close to defeat.

    During the last years i was repeatedly severely wounded. I feel like my end is near and i have to prepare my son Hasdrubal for his upcoming responsibilities as the ruler of our great nation.</English>
